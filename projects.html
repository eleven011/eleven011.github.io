            <p>Frupal is a web-based game I made with a group of classmates for CS300 at PSU. This app is built almost entirely in JavaScript. Click on the image if you're interested in trying it out!</p>

            <h2>Ping CLI</h2>
            <p>My_ping is a command line interface ping application. I made this as part of an internship application. This app sends a "ping" to a host in order to test how reachable that host is. My_ping is written entirely in C.</p>

            <h2>Carduino</h2>
            <p>Carduino is an arduino-driven car project created by me and my fellow mentors for our mentees. My coworkers and I worked for an organization at PSU that supports traditionally underrepresented students in STEM called "Scholars for Success in STEM" or S^3. This was our end of year project.</p>
