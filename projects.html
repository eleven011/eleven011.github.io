            <h2>AnimalHelper</h2>
            <p>This is a voice-chatbot I started in Voice Technologies through PSU. The objective is to help pet owners seek advice on various situations concerning their pets.</p>
            <p>AnimalHelper is built using DialogFlow, so I used the platform and wrote my code in JavaScript.</p>

            <h2>InstaServe</h2>
            <p>InstaServe is a mobile application I developed with my Capstone team. This was a 6 month project with 7 other team members using React-Native.</p>
            <p>The purpose of this app is to increase Covid-friendliness for restaurants and their patrons by allowing the patron to handle all interactions with wait staff from their phone.</p>

            <p>Carduino is an arduino-driven car project created by me and my fellow mentors for our mentees. My coworkers and I worked for an organization at PSU that supports traditionally underrepresented students in STEM called "Scholars for Success in STEM" or S^3. This was our end of year project.</p>
